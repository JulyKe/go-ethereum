there are two nodes : node1 and node2
node1 has 13 blocks now
rm -r node2/chaindata, to remove all the blocks on node2
we start node2 and do local mining:
./startNode2 --mine
then attach ipc:node2/geth.ipc to do remote importing as below:
admin.importChain("node1BlockChain")
because in worker.go, we already sleep 20s before writeBlock(), which means we delay the mined block to the chain and make importing 13 blocks finish first
after return ture from importChain() above

the currentBlock is changed in the chain, then the worker's mined block's parent is not equal to the chain's current block anaymore, then
it will mark the mined block is a stale block and continue mining new blocks, however, almost all future blocks' parents are not equal to
chain's parent, then leading to the chain stop growing.
